C     This is a modified version of Warren P. Porter's microclimate mode that is now
C     called as a subroutine from R. It has been modified from the original version by 
C     Michael Kearney to handle any time period, to have time-varying soil properties as 
C     a function of temperature and water, and has an optional full water balance model 
C     based on the equations and code of Campbell 1985 Soil Physics with Basic. It includes
c     an optional snow model that simulates snow accumulation and melt and its effect on 
c     soil temperature. It no longer writes out temporary data (to dataky.dat).
c     The program and associated package is fully described in the publication
c     Kearney, M. R., and W. P. Porter. 2017. NicheMapR - an R package for biophysical modelling: 
c     the microclimate model. Ecography 40:664–674.
c     The full package is available at http://github.com/mrke/NicheMapR/

C     SOLRAD computes clear sky solar radiation for anywhere
C     IOSOLR is for solrad input and min, max values &
c       for input of time dependent variables, air temperature,
C       relative humidity, cloud cover, and wind speed
c     GAMMA computes scattered radiation in the ultraviolet to high precision.
c     GAMMA calls DCHXY and DEXPI during its calculations.
C     SINEC computes time dependent values of air temperature
C     VSINE computes time dependent values of relative humidity,
C      cloud cover & wind speed.
c     RDCTRL controls reading of variables rearranged for input to the
c       meteorology program
c     RDTABL reads table data of time dependent input variables, e.g. air
c       temperature, solar radiation, etc.
c     PTTABL prints out time dependent tables
c     SFODE is the Gear Predictor-Corrector numerical integration program
c       that solves the simultaneous heat balance equations for temperatures.
c     DSUB is the subroutine containing the heat balance equations in
c       derivative form, which is called by SFODE.
c     OSUB outputs the microclimate calculations.
