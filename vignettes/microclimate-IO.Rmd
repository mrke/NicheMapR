This vignette runs through the core inputs and outputs of the NicheMapR microclimate model. It provides a basis for developing scripts and functions that are customised to particular databases of climate/weather, terrain, vegetation and soil properties.

### Model mode settings

```
writecsv <- 0 # make Fortran program write output as csv files
microdaily <- 0 # run microclimate where each day is iterated 3 times starting with the initial condition of uniform soil temp at mean monthly temperature (0) or with initial conditions of each day based on final conditions of previous day (1)
runshade <- 1 # run the model twice, once for each shade level (1) or just for the first shade level (0)?
IR <- 0 # Clear-sky longwave radiation computed using Campbell and Norman (1998) eq. 10.10 (includes humidity) (0) or Swinbank formula (1)
runmoist <- 1 # run soil moisture model (0=no, 1=yes)?
snowmodel <- 1 # run the snow model (0=no, 1=yes)? - note that this runs slower
hourly <- 0 # use hourly input data?
solonly <- 0 # only run SOLRAD to get solar radiation? 1=yes, 0=no
lamb <- 0 # return wavelength-specific solar radiation output?
IUV <- 0 # use gamma function for scattered solar radiation? 
ndmax <- 3 # iterations of first day to get a steady periodic
message <- 0 # allow the Fortran integrator to output warnings? (1) or not (0)
fail <- 1*24*365 # how many restarts of the integrator before the Fortran program quits (avoids endless loops when solutions can't be found)
spinup <- 1 # repeat each day three times to get steady period solution? 0 is no, 1 is yes. Set to 1 for daily runs where the initial soil temps are the previous day's final temps.
maxsurf <- 95 # deg C, maximum allowable surface temperature for stability purposes
dewrain <- 0 # feed dew into soil as rain? (0 is no, 1 is yes)
moiststep <- 360 # how many seconds is each time step when simulating soil moisture (3600 would result in the integrator being hourly)
```

### Time and location parameters
```
ndays <- 12 # number of time intervals to generate predictions for over a year (must be 12 <= x <=365)
doy <- c(15, 46, 74, 105, 135, 166, 196, 227, 258, 288, 319, 349) # middle day of each month
idayst <- 1 # start day (legacy parameter)
ida <- ndays # end day (legacy parameter)
HEMIS <- 1 # chose hemisphere
ALAT <- 43 # degrees latitude
AMINUT <- 4.383 # minutes latitude
ALONG <- 89 # degrees longitude
ALMINT <- 24.074 # minutes latitude
ALREF <- 89 # reference longitude for time zone
EC <- 0.0167238 # Eccenricity of the earth's orbit (current value 0.0167238, ranges between 0.0034 to 0.058)
```

### Air and wind vertical profile parameters
```
RUF <- 0.004 # Roughness height (m), , e.g. sand is 0.05, grass may be 2.0, current allowed range: 0.001 (snow) - 2.0 cm.
Refhyt <- 2 # Reference height (m), reference height at which air temperature, wind speed and relative humidity input data are measured
Usrhyt <- 0.01# local height (m) at which air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed calculatinos will be made
ZH <- 0 # heat transfer roughness height (m) for Campbell and Norman air temperature/wind speed profile (invoked if greater than 1, 0.02 * canopy height in m if unknown)
D0 <- 0 # zero plane displacement correction factor (m) for Campbell and Norman air temperature/wind speed profile (0.6 * canopy height in m if unknown)
# Next four parameters are segmented velocity profiles due to bushes, rocks etc. on the surface
#IF NO EXPERIMENTAL WIND PROFILE DATA SET ALL THESE TO ZERO! (then roughness height is based on the parameter RUF)
Z01 <- 0 # Top (1st) segment roughness height(m)
Z02 <- 0 # 2nd segment roughness height(m)
ZH1 <- 0 # Top of (1st) segment, height above surface(m)
ZH2 <- 0 # 2nd segment, height above surface(m)
```

### Radiation-related parameters
```
SLE <- 0.96 # substrate longwave IR emissivity (decimal %), typically close to 1
REFL <- 0.10 # substrate solar reflectivity (decimal %)
CMH2O <- 1 # precipitable cm H2O in air column, 0.1 = VERY DRY; 1.0 = MOIST AIR CONDITIONS; 2.0 = HUMID, TROPICAL CONDITIONS (note this is for the whole atmospheric profile, not just near the ground)
# Aerosol extinction coefficient profile

### Intertidal simulation parameteres (currently experimental and untested)

```
# intertidal simulation input vector (col 1 = tide in(1)/out(0), col 2 = sea water temperature in deg C, col 3 = % wet from wave splash)
tides <- matrix(data = 0, nrow = 24*ndays, ncol = 3) # matrix for tides
```

### Collating all input parameters
```
# input parameter vector

# Final input list - all these variables are expected by the input argument of the Fortran microclimate subroutine

### Executing the microclimate model
```
microut <- microclimate(micro) # run the model in Fortran
```

### Retrieving the data
```
metout <- as.data.frame(microut$metout[1:(ndays * 24), ]) # retrieve above ground microclimatic conditions, min shade
shadmet <- as.data.frame(microut$shadmet[1:(ndays * 24), ]) # retrieve above ground microclimatic conditions, max shade
soil <- as.data.frame(microut$soil[1:(ndays * 24), ]) # retrieve soil temperatures, minimum shade
shadsoil <- as.data.frame(microut$shadsoil[1:(ndays * 24), ]) # retrieve soil temperatures, maximum shade
soilmoist <- as.data.frame(microut$soilmoist[1:(ndays * 24), ]) # retrieve soil moisture, minimum shade
shadmoist <- as.data.frame(microut$shadmoist[1:(ndays * 24), ]) # retrieve soil moisture, maximum shade
humid <- as.data.frame(microut$humid[1:(ndays * 24), ]) # retrieve soil humidity, minimum shade
shadhumid <- as.data.frame(microut$shadhumid[1:(ndays * 24), ]) # retrieve soil humidity, maximum shade
soilpot <- as.data.frame(microut$soilpot[1:(ndays * 24), ]) # retrieve soil water potential, minimum shade
shadpot <- as.data.frame(microut$shadpot[1:(ndays * 24), ]) # retrieve soil water potential, maximum shade
```
