This vignette runs through the core inputs and outputs of the NicheMapR microclimate model, using monthly mean inputs for Madison Wisconsin, USA. It provides a basis for developing scripts and functions that are customised to particular databases of climate/weather, terrain, vegetation and soil properties. See also the [microclimate-hourly-input-example](microclimate-hourly-input-example.Rmd) vignette for an illustration of how to set the model to run from hourly input across all days of a year. It is Appendix 3 of the NicheMapR microclimate software note, Porter and Kearney (2016). NicheMapR - an R package for biophysical modelling: the microclimate model. Ecography x(x) p. x-x.

### Model mode settings

```{r}

writecsv<-0 # make Fortran program write output as csv files
microdaily<-0 # run microclimate model as normal, where each day is iterated 3 times starting with the initial condition of uniform soil temp at mean monthly temperature
runshade<-1 # run the model twice, once for each shade level (1) or just for the first shade level (0)?
runmoist<-1 # run soil moisture model (0=no, 1=yes)?
snowmodel<-1 # run the snow model (0=no, 1=yes)? - note that this runs slower
hourly<-0 # run from hourly weather input (0=no, 1=yes)?
rainhourly<-0 # run from hourly weather input (0=no, 1=yes)?
