\arguments{
\item{t}{= seq(1,3600,60), time intervals (s) at which output is required}

\item{Tc_init}{= 5, initial temperature (deg C)}

\item{mass}{= 500, animal mass (g)}

\item{geom}{= 2, Organism shape, 0-5, Determines whether standard or custom shapes/surface area/volume relationships are used: 0=plate, 1=cyl, 2=ellips, 3=lizard (desert iguana), 4=frog (leopard frog), 5=custom (see parameter 'shape_coefs')}

\item{Tair}{= 30, air temperature (deg C)}

\item{Trad}{= 30, radiant temperature (deg C), averaging ground and sky}

\item{vel}{= 0.1, wind speed (m/s)}

\item{Qsol}{= 500, solar radiation (W/m2)}

\item{Zen}{= 20, zenith angle of sun (90 is below horizon), degrees}

\item{kflesh}{= 0.5, Thermal conductivity of flesh (W/mK, range: 0.412-2.8)}

\item{q}{= 0, metabolic heat production rate W/m3}

\item{cp}{= 3073, Specific heat of flesh J/(kg-K)}

\item{emis}{= 0.95, Emissivity of animal (0-1)}

\item{rho}{= 932, animal density (kg/m3)}

\item{abs}{= 0.85, solar absorptivity, decimal percent}

\item{shape_coefs}{= c(10.4713,.688,0.425,0.85,3.798,.683,0.694,.743), Custom shape coefficients. Operates if geom=5, and consists of 4 pairs of values representing the parameters a and b of a relationship AREA=a*mass^b, where AREA is in cm2 and mass is in g. The first pair are a and b for total surface area, then a and b for ventral area, then for sillhouette area normal to the sun, then sillhouette area perpendicular to the sun}

\item{shape_b}{= 1/5, Proportionality factor (-) for going from volume to area, represents ratio of width:height for a plate, length:diameter for cylinder, b axis:a axis for ellipsoid}

\item{shape_c}{= 1/5, Proportionality factor (-) for going from volume to area, represents ratio of length:height for a plate, c axis:a axis for ellipsoid}

\item{posture}{= 'n' pointing normal 'n', parallel 'p' to the sun's rays, or 'b' in between?}

\item{orient}{= 1, does the object orient toward the sun? (0,1)}

\item{fatosk}{= 0.4, Configuration factor to sky (-) for infrared calculations}

\item{fatosb}{= 0.4, Configuration factor to subsrate for infrared calculations}

\item{abs_sub}{= 0.2, substrate solar reflectivity, decimal percent}

\item{pctdif}{= 0.1, proportion of solar energy that is diffuse (rather than direct beam)}

\item{press}{= 101325, air pressure (Pa)}
