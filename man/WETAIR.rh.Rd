\description{
Calculates several properties of humid air as output variables below. The program
is based on equations from List, R. J. 1971. Smithsonian Meteorological Tables. Smithsonian
Institution Press. Washington, DC. WETAIR must be used in conjunction with function VAPPRS.
}
\details{
Input variables are shown below. The user must supply known values for rh, db and pb (bp at one standard
atmosphere is 101 325 pascals).
