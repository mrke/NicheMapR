plantgro(soilpot = soilpot, soilmoist = soilmoist, root_shallow = 4,
  root_deep = 8, growth_delay = 1, wilting_thresh = -200,
  permanent_wilting_point = -1500, FoodWater = 82)
}
\arguments{
\item{soilpot}{= soilpot, vector of soil water potential to use for calculations}

\item{soilmoist}{= soilmoist, vector of soil moisture to use for calculations}

\item{root_shallow}{= 4shallowest soil node to use when getting average soil moisture/water potential for calculating plant moisture/growth}

\item{root_deep}{= 4, deepest soil node to use when getting average soil moisture/water potential for calculating plant moisture/growth}

\item{growth_delay}{= 0, time required for plants to recover after hitting permanent wilting point, days}

\item{wilting_thresh}{= -200, soil water potential at wilting point, J/kg}

\item{permanent_wilting_point}{= -1500, soil water potential at permanent wilting point, J/kg}

\item{FoodWater}{= 82, Maximum water conten of plant, \%}
}
\description{
Function to compute plant water content given threshold values of soil water potential at which wilting point and permanent wilting point occurs
