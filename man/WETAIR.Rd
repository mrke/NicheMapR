\description{
Calculates several properties of humid air as output variables below. The program
is based on equations from List, R. J. 1971. Smithsonian Meteorological Tables. Smithsonian
Institution Press. Washington, DC. WETAIR must be used in conjunction with function VAPPRS.
}
\details{
Input variables are shown below. The user must supply known values for DB and BP (BP at one standard
atmosphere is 101 325 pascals). Values for the remaining variables are determined by whether the user has
either (1) psychrometric data (WB or RH), or (2) hygrometric data (DP)

(1) Psychrometric data:
If WB is known but not RH, then set RH=-1 and DP=999
If RH is known but not WB then set WB=0 and DP=999

(2) Hygrometric data:
If DP is known then set WB = 0 and RH = 0.
