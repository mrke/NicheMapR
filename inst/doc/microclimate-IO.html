<p>This vignette runs through the core inputs and outputs of the NicheMapR microclimate model. It provides a basis for developing scripts and functions that are customised to particular databases of climate/weather, terrain, vegetation and soil properties.</p>
<div id="model-mode-settings" class="section level3">
<h3>Model mode settings</h3>

snowmodel &lt;- 1 # run the snow model (0=no, 1=yes)? - note that this runs slower
